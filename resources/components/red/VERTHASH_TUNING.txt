Team Red Miner Verthash Mining
============================
This document provides some quick pointers on how to tune the verthash
algo used by Vertcoin.


General background
==================
Verthash is a memory-intensive low power algo. That said, the core clk
on (primarily GCN) gpus needs to be high (much higher than ethash) to
support driving the mem controller on the gpu(s), this at least if you
want to achieve the max possible hashrate.

This algo accesses mem in 32 byte chunks. This means that RDNA
generation gpus (Navi, Big Navi) will not perform well. Their 128 byte
cacheline size means that 128 bytes are read for every 32 byte
request, effectively halving the available memory bandwidth compared
to GCN (which uses 64 byte cachelines).


GCN gpus: Vega/Polaris
======================
- Your core clock needs to be quite high to support the memory subsystem.

- The algo is still quite low power, even with the high core clk.

- Mem clock also needs to be high.

- Timings mods didn't do much in our quick tests, but further tests
  are needed.

- Polaris high-quality straps are important. More tests needed, but
  latency-focused CN straps might be better than pure bandwidth straps
  for ethash. Ethash-tuned gpus should generally do fine though.

- In our Polaris tests, a Nitro 470 4GB (Elpida), Nitro+ 570 8GB
  (Samsung) and Nitro+ 580 8GB (Samsung) all displayed identical
  hashrates for the same core clk as long as memory bandwidth was
  sufficient.

RX Vega tuning examples
-----------------------
Note: sensor power reported, not accurate.

Note: these high core clks on linux are scaled down very aggressively
by the driver, expect to run lower core clks for the same hashrate on
Windows.

Before increasing core clks, the V64 LC was tuned for ethash 50.8
MH/s. The V56 ref was tuned aggressively for 53.5 MH/s with at 980 MHz
mem clk. The V56 Hynix was tuned for 48 MH/s ethash.

The V56 Hynix is an old busted card, the sensor power is most likely
off.

At the time of writing we don't know why the V64 LC is underperforming
below, it might just have a lower effective core clk.

Type           GPU CUs CoreMHz MemMHz TEdge TMem  VDDC   Power

------------------------ GPU Status ---------------------------
GPU 0 [35C, fan 57%]       verthash: 1.163Mh/s, avg 1.064Mh/s
GPU 1 [60C, fan 60%]       verthash: 1.206Mh/s, avg 1.103Mh/s
GPU 2 [56C, fan 99%]       verthash: 1.195Mh/s, avg 1.164Mh/s


Radeon VII tuning examples
--------------------------
Note: sensor power reported, not accurate.

The VIIs also need a high core clk to support a higher hashrate. The
mem clk can typically be lowered as much as possible. To reach max
speed, the Radeon VII boost setup like for ethash mining must be in
place. Follow the instructions in the ethash tuning guide to enable
it.

Most likely, VIIs will always be better at mining ethash than
verthash, but these are tuning examples:

Type        GPU CUs CoreMHz MemMHz TEdge TMem   VDDC   Power
Radeon VII  0   60  1600    801    52C   60C    893 mV 123 W
Radeon VII  1   60  1900    801    63C   69C   1043 mV 183 W
------------------------ GPU Status ---------------------------
GPU 0 [52C, fan  0%]       verthash: 1.543Mh/s, avg 1.508Mh/s
GPU 1 [63C, fan  0%]       verthash: 1.843Mh/s, avg 1.802Mh/s


Navi GPUs
=========
As stated above, Navis simply won't do that well on verthash due to
architectural changes that don't work well with verthash's smaller mem
accesses. Therefore, we don't expect RDNA gpus to run verthash, but
these are some ethash clock examples with hashrates:

Type    GPU CUs CoreMHz SocMHz MemMHz TEdge TMem  VDDC   Power
5700XT  0   40  1250    1085   912    52C   78C   787 mV  86 W
5600XT  1   36  1100    1266   910    49C   80C   800 mV  91 W
------------------------ GPU Status ---------------------------
GPU 0 [52C, fan 32%]       verthash: 859.1kh/s, avg 840.8kh/s
GPU 1 [49C, fan 99%]       verthash: 653.0kh/s, avg 625.8kh/s
