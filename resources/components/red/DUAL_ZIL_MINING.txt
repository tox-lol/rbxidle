Team Red Miner Dual ZIL Mining
==============================
This document describes how to enable dual ZIL mining in TRM together
with a range of other primary algos. It describes both the new
mechanism introduced in v0.8.3 and the older variant that only can be
used when the primary algo is ethash (including etchash).


New mechanism from v0.8.3
-------------------------
From v0.8.3, take any existing TRM command line configuration for
ethash, kawpow, verthash or autolykos and add:

--zil -o stratum+tcp://eu.ezil.me:5555 -u <eth wallet>.<zil wallet>.<worker> -p x --zil_end

preferably at the end of the command line. The miner will pause the
primary algo and switch to ZIL during the ZIL windows, then switch
back to the primary algo afterwards. More primary algos might be added
if there's enough interest. The intention is that the miner
automatically configures the primary algo to work well with the dual
ZIL mining. It is fully possible to add more arguments between the
--zil and --zil_end arguments, all arguments in USAGE.txt are
available, but the default configuration chosen by the miner should be
optimal for most setups with the following settings:

- Cached copy of the ZIL epoch 0 DAG.
- Adjustment of memory allocated for the primary algo to fit the ZIL DAG.
- Choose ethash A-mode for the ZIL mining.
- Use the standard faster kernels for 4GB gpus since the DAG is max 1GB.


Pool Support
------------
We have primarily tested on ezil.me, and cleared that they are ok with
having empty connections that only mine during ZIL windows. Other
pools like rustpool.xyz and K1Pool should work ok as well.


Potential issues with ethash B/C-mode
-------------------------------------
The TRM B- and C-modes want to use as much vram as possible. The value
of the B/C-mode is diminished as the amount of allocated vram
decreases. This typically means you need to increase the core clk for
a preserved hashrate.

When you add dual ZIL mining to an existing mining config where one or
more gpus are running in B/C-mode, there's an obvious conflict of
interest: to be able to immediately start mining ZIL, you want the DAG
for epoch zero cached and ready in vram. This will consume around 1GB,
and therefore steal vram from the B/C-modes.

The auto config mode with --zil ... --zil_end will automatically
reduce the vram allocated for B/C-modes to make room for the cached
ZIL DAG. If you e.g. run a rig of 5700XTs running in B-mode mining ETH
and then add ZIL, you will most probably see a reduced hashrate during
the ETH mining and need to increase core clk.

If you want to keep your current ETH tuning, the other way is to use
the old way of running dual ZIL mining (see section below), and simply
not cache the ZIL DAG but rebuild DAGs as you enter/exit the ZIL
mining windows. This will steal some mining time for each ZIL window
instead.


Old mechanism up until v0.8.2.1
-------------------------------
Before v0.8.3, TRM only supported dual ZIL mining together with any
other ethash coin, typically ETH or ETC. This configuration was more
complex. You needed to:

- Set the pool strategy to --pool_strategy=min_epoch.

- Configure multiple pools, where the first pool must be the ETH/ETC
  primary pool.

- Instruct the miner to use a DAG cache and to prebuild epoch zero
  using --eth_dag_cache=0. This is an optional step.

- When using a DAG cache, not use B/C-modes on any gpus by adding
  e.g. --eth_config=A.

This way of running dual ZIL mining is still fully supported, and the
recommended way in some special cases (see the Potential issues
section). See the start script bundled in the miner release for a
working example.
