TeamRedMiner Ethash 0.7.x to 0.8.0 Transition Guide 
===================================================

TL;DR

- TRM v0.8.0 contains rewritten kernels for all gpu types.

- Efficiency improvements for all gpus.

- New B/C-modes are introduced utilizing more vram on all gpus. Must have driver
  support for large allocations, meaning amdgpu-pro >= 20.30 or Adrenalin >=
  20.9.1.

- Polaris: Efficiency and slight hashrate increase. B-mode reintroduced for
  added hash. B-mode must be enabled with --eth_aggr_mode.

- Vega 56/64: greatly improved base kernel for efficiency. New B-mode that can
  shave off additional 1-2W. B-mode must be enabled manually with --eth_config.
  Tuning numbers have changed - do NOT keep your old static --eth_config values.

- Radeon VII: huge boost in its new C-mode but requires a special Linux
  setup. Can now do 100 MH/s on air cooling.

- 5700/5700XT: can shave off as much as 8-9W(!) of power using the new B-mode
  and dropping core clk+voltage. B-mode now the default mining mode.

- 5600XT: new B-mode has a much smaller effect and must be enabled and tuned
  manually. A-mode remains the default mining mode. See new tuning guide for
  details.

- For most gpus, intensity numbers are now very different from before. Please
  remove any static --eth_config argument and let the miner run the auto-tune
  process once.

- Ethash 4GB kernels are NOT rewritten in this release, performance remains the
  same as in 0.7.x.

- The dag cache is NOT compatible with the B/C-mode. ETH+ZIL switchers have to
  choose between caching the epoch 0 dag and using the new mining modes.


Performance changes between 0.7.21 and 0.8.0
============================================
- Tests were made on Ubuntu 18.04 using amdgpu-pro 20.30.

- The gpu power sensor was polled 4096 times over a few minutes, average
  provided. Power numbers should NOT be confused with proper at-the-wall
  measurements. The numbers here are merely provided to indicate the change in
  power draw between versions.

- Clocks and voltages listed as provided by linux sysfs. ETH epoch 389 was
  mined.

- Navis are still compared to 0.7.21 although a pre-release of the new Navi
  kernel was made in TRM 0.7.22. The differences between 0.7.22 and 0.8.0 are
  additional small optimizations and the new B-mode.

Cooling Transition
==================
All of the new kernels runs with less compute work needed per hash compared to
earlier TRM versions. This typically results in lower power draw, all else being
equal, and that it will be slightly easier to cool your gpu. However, the memory
has exactly the same cooling requirements as previous versions, and even higher
requirements if v0.8.0 runs at a higher hashrate.

The effect is that any cooling setup not using a static fan speed but targeting
a specific core temp is at risk of providing insufficient mem cooling. In turn,
this can lead to increased instability. Therefore, make sure you either lower
any dynamic fan target system based on core temp a degree or two, or if you know
your previous fan speeds, make sure fans are not running lower than before. You
can also use the TRM built-in fan control to target a specific mem temp for
Vegas/Navis.


Polaris Transition
==================
Polaris gpus/rigs can simply start the miner at the old clocks and voltages. The
normal outcome is a higher hashrate at a lower power draw, but this can vary
depending on clocks and memory straps. A slightly higher hashrate always mean
higher pressure on the memory subsystem. You might have to clock down slightly
to avoid hw errs or crashes, converting the added hashrate capacity into a power
save and higher efficiency instead.

The reintroduced B-mode usually adds 0.1-0.2 MH/s of extra hashrate. It is not
enabled by default since it's often harder to run stable over time compared to
the normal A-mode. Like in previous TRM versions, you enable it with
--eth_aggr_mode or manual --eth_config=Bxxx arguments. You must run a driver
that supports large allocations, i.e. amdgpu-pro >= 20.30 or Adrenalin >=
20.9.1.

Note: eth config numbers have been rescaled. Do NOT keep old --eth_config
arguments with hardcoded configs around, let the miner run the auto-tune at
least once before setting a new static config.


Vega 56/64 Transition
=====================
Vega 56/64 can run at their old clocks and voltages and should see a power
reduction of up to 4-5W when running at 50+ MH/s speeds, sometimes converted
into a slightly increased hashrate and a lower power draw reduction instead.

Users that care about efficiency should try the new B-mode. It needs to be
enabled manually by adding --eth_config=Bxxx for all Vega gpus in the rig. You
must run a driver that supports large allocations, i.e. amdgpu-pro >= 20.30 or
Adrenalin >= 20.9.1. Typically, you can simply reduce your core clk 30-80 MHz
compared to running in A-mode. Hashrate will be preserved or lose a minimal
amount, and your power draw will go down 1-2W. Depending on your overall config,
you might be able to further reduce core clk while preserving the hashrate. You
can also try tuning down voltage just slightly after lowering core clk.

The normal A-mode is chosen as default for Vega 56/64 since early tests have
indicated that the B-mode is slightly harder to keep running stable. This is
highly dependent on the custom timing mods in use though.

Note: eth config numbers have been rescaled. Do NOT keep old --eth_config
arguments with hardcoded configs around, let the miner run the auto-tune at
least once before setting a new static config.


Radeon VII Transition
=====================
In the v0.8.0 release we have introduced a new C-mode for Radeon VIIs that can
increase hashrate by 10+% depending on clocks, and can now hit 100MH/s on air
cooling.  However this new C-mode requires running on Linux, making Linux
kernel boot parameter changes, and running the miner as root.  For full
details, see Radeon VII section in the tuning guide.

For those users upgrading to v0.8.0 but not trying to use C mode, you will see
a significant power reduction of around 6-9W.  Your existing clocks, voltages,
and timings should work without needing adjustment and you can just sit back
and enjoy your power savings.

Note: eth config numbers have been rescaled. Do NOT keep old --eth_config
arguments with hardcoded configs around, let the miner run the auto-tune at
least once before setting a new static config.


Navi 5700XT/5700 Transition
===========================
If a driver that supports large allocations is installed, the miner will default
5700XT/5700s to the new B-mode, using as much vram as possible on the gpu. The
main benefit from using this mode is support for high hashrates at significantly
lower core clk+voltage settings compare to A-mode and previous TRM versions.

For a 5700XT/5700 tuned to previous TRM versions, our tests indicate that you
can drop core clk ~100 MHz and voltage -50mV in B-mode while still preserving
hashrate (although often with a tiny loss). The efficiency increase is an
obvious trade-off win even with a small hashrate decrease. If you're on a well
defined voltage curve, you shouldn't have to touch your voltage settings,
lowering the core clk is enough, otherwise you should lower voltage manually as
well. You might need to retune if gpus crash at the lower settings, slightly
raising voltage until stable again.

If you for some reason can't run in the new B-mode, you can switch to the A-mode
manually with --eth_config=Axxx (if you're not familiar with this argument, see
USAGE.txt for more info).


Navi 5600XT Transition
===========================
The 5600XT does not have enough vram to make the new B-mode a huge power draw
win like for 5700XT/5700s. Therefore, the miner runs in A-mode by default, and
you should simply be able to just run at your old clocks/voltages.

For users who care about efficiency, there is usually a 1-3W power save to be
found by forcing B-mode using --eth_config=B, then slowly lowering core clk
while making sure your original hashrate is preserved at each lower step. You
should be able to drop it 25-30 MHz or more from a tuning that is balanced for
A-mode. If you still run at the same voltage as before (and not with a curve
that automatically lowers voltage with core clk), you should be able to drop it
slightly to realize the power save.


Happy mining!
