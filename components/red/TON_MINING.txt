Team Red Miner TON Mining
=========================

TL;DR
-----

TRM supports four TON pools:

- Icemining
- Ton Coin Pool (using built-in wss proxy)
- Whales Ton Pool (using their tcp stratum endpoint)
- TON Pool (using the built-in wss proxy)

Whales Ton Pool and TON Pool needs wallet registration with their
Telegram bots before starting to mine.  Use the following pool
arguments to mine:

Icemining: -o stratum+tcp://ton.hashrate.to:4002 -u <ton wallet>.<worker> -p x

Ton Coin Pool: -o stratum+tcp://pplns.toncoinpool.io:443/stratum -u <ton wallet> -p <worker>

Whales Ton Pool: -o stratum+tcp://tcp.whalestonpool.com:4001 -u <ton wallet> -p x

TON Pool: -o stratum+tcp://eu1.stratum.ton-pool.com:443/stratum -u <ton wallet> -p x

Last, see the TON section in USAGE.txt or the miner's --help output
for additional arguments.


Background
-----------
TON is a special pow mining coin since submitted solutions aren't used
for network blocks and chain security like in standard pow
blockchains. Instead, TON has 10 smart contracts called "givers" that
simply reward you for hashing and submitting solutions directly to the
contracts. The remaining pool of available coins from the "givers" is
expected to last until mid-2022.

There is no single standard pool protocol for TON. All pools must be
handled as separate implementations. TRM currently support the
following pools:

- Icemining (icemining.ca, beta stratum url ton.hashrate.to)

- TON Coin Pool (toncoinpool.io)

- Whales TON Pool (tonwhales.com)

- TON Pool (ton-pool.com)


Specifying Pool Protocol
------------------------
If you use the standard URLs for the supported pools, TRM will
automatically understand what pool protocol dialect to use. However,
if you tunnel the pool, connect by direct IP, or use some other
network mechanism that doesn't present the normal hostname to TRM you
must manually state which pool protocol should be used. This is done
using the --ton_pool_mode argument. These are the available options:

--ton_pool_mode=icemining (used by Icemining and Whales TON Pool)

--ton_pool_mode=toncoinpool

--ton_pool_mode=tonpool


Web Service Proxy
-----------------
Many TON pools use web service protocols for its communication. TRM
does not include support for ws:// or wss:// in order to not violate
open source licenses, and we don't intend to spend the time
implementing support from scratch. Instead, we ship a proxy binary
that is compiled from a published open source project originally
written for mining Nimiq, which also uses wss:// for pool protocol
communication. The source code is available here:

https://github.com/Kerney666/trm_nimiq_proxy

The proxy is bundled in our release package and will be executed
automatically for you when necessary.


How to mine at Icemining
------------------------
Simply point TRM to the pool like for any other mining algorithm. TRM
will automatically split the worker name from the wallet if we find
that it ends with '.yourworkername'. It is not an official format for
specifying the worker. Replace ./teamredminer with teamredminer.exe
on Windows.

./teamredminer --a ton o stratum+tcp://ton.hashrate.to:4002 -u <ton wallet>.<worker> -p x


How to mine at Ton Coin Pool
----------------------------
Use the following format to mine at Ton Coin Pool. Replace
./teamredminer with teamredminer.exe on Windows.

./teamredminer -a ton -o stratum+tcp://pplns.toncoinpool.io:443/stratum -u <ton wallet> -p <worker>


How to mine at Whales Ton Pool
------------------------------
First, make sure you've registered your wallet with the Telegram
bot. Go to https://tonwhales.com/ to read more.  Next. use the
following format to mine at Whales Ton Pool. Replace ./teamredminer
with teamredminer.exe on Windows.

./teamredminer -a ton -o stratum+tcp://tcp.whalestonpool.com:4001 -u <ton wallet> -p x


How to mine at Ton Pool
-----------------------
Use the following format to mine at Ton Pool. Replace ./teamredminer
with teamredminer.exe on Windows.

./teamredminer -a ton -o stratum+tcp://eu1.stratum.ton-pool.com:443/stratum -u <ton wallet> -p <worker>
